        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Short Note on Web Development and Its Tools and Applications</h1>
        <p>Web Development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves a range of tasks, from designing the visual layout of a website to coding the backend functionality that makes it interactive and dynamic. Web development is broadly divided into two main categories:

        </p>
        <!--INLINE CSS-->
        <h2 style="color:blue";>Frontend Development: </h2>
        <p>This focuses on the part of a website that users interact with directly. It involves using languages like HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create and style web pages. Frontend developers work on the user interface (UI), ensuring that the website is visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive across different devices.</p>
        <h2 style="color:blue";>Backend Development: </h2>
        <p>This deals with the server side of web applications, including database management, server logic, and application integration. Backend developers use programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and frameworks like Node.js or Django to build the underlying functionality that supports the frontend.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Tools for Web Development</h1>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(239, 17, 17)";>1. Text Editors and IDEs:</h2>
        <p>Tools like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom provide a platform for writing and editing code efficiently. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse offer additional features like debugging, code suggestions, and version control integration.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red";>Version Control Systems:</h2>
        <p>Tools like Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab help developers manage and track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers, and maintain different versions of their projects.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:red";>Frameworks and Libraries:</h2>
        <p>Frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and backend frameworks (e.g., Express.js, Laravel, Flask) provide pre-built components and libraries that speed up development and ensure consistent code practices.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red";>Content Management Systems (CMS):</h2>
        <p>Tools like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal simplify the creation and management of content on websites, allowing non-developers to manage and update sites easily.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red";>Design and Prototyping Tools:</h2>
        <p>Tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch are used for designing the layout and user experience (UX) of a website before it is coded.</p>
        <h2 style="color:red";>Testing and Debugging Tools:</h2>
        <p>Tools such as Selenium, Jest, and Postman are used for testing and debugging web applications to ensure they function correctly across different browsers and devices.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Applications of Web Development</h1>
